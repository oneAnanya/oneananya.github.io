            <h2>Sliding Window Protocols</h2>
            <p>In the virtual world of Dataville, lived two tech cuties, Rosu and Babu. Their love for technology, especially computer networking, often led to awkwardly funny situations. Today, they found themselves tangled up in rains of error involving sliding window protocols.</p>

            <h2>Scene 1: The Window Size</h2>
            <p>Rosu and Babu decided to set up a new fishing network in their shared apartment. Babu, the optimist, insisted they use the maximum window size for their data packets. “More packets, more speed!” she proclaimed. She knew, Rosu's laptop was the ultimate over-thinker. The flood of packets overwhelmed it, causing it to freeze spectacularly. Rosu teases her, “Looks like we need a smaller window for my slowpoke laptop!”</p>

            <h2>Scene 2: Stop-and-Wait</h2>
            <p>Determined to fix their network, they switched to the Stop-and-Wait protocol. Babu sent one packet and waited for Rosu's acknowledgment. Unfortunately, Babu’s lazy kitty, Anu, decided to sit on Rosu’s keyboard. The acknowledgment never came, leaving Babu waiting... and waiting. “I guess even packets get stuck in traffic,” she sighed, watching Anu nap away.</p>

            <h2>Scene 3: Go-Back-N</h2>
            <p>Frustrated, they moved on to the Go-Back-N protocol. Babu sent multiple packets without waiting, feeling this time this gonna happen. Suddenly, a naughty fly landed on Rosu’s laptop, causing it to skip a beat and miss a packet. Babu had to resend not just the missed packet but all subsequent ones. Rosu laughed, “Who knew a tiny fly could cause such a packet disaster?”</p>

            <h2>Scene 4: Selective Repeat</h2>
            <p>Finally, they tried the Selective Repeat protocol. Babu, now a packet-sending pro, sent packets like a machine. This time, when a packet got lost, only the lost one was retransmitted. Babu felt victorious until Anu returned, knocking over a glass of water onto Rosu’s keyboard. “Selective Repeat, meet selective flood!” Rosu broke into laughing, as Babu dived to dry off her laptop.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical Analysis</h2>
            <p>In this story, sliding window protocols turned into a series of mishaps for Rosu and Babu. The Stop-and-Wait protocol began a struggle with waiting for acknowledgments, while the Go-Back-N protocol highlighting the chaos of multiple retransmissions. The Selective Repeat protocol provided a better solution, but no match for Anu’s laziness.</p>
