            <h2>WebSocket and WebRTC</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, in the mysterious Forest of Connectivity, lived two wizards: WebSocket and WebRTC.</p>
            <p>WebSocket, the steady messenger, had a special talent for creating a continuous, two-way communication tunnel between the Kingdom of Clients and the Castle of Servers. This tunnel allowed messages to travel back and forth instantly, just like a magical talking mirror. Whenever villagers wanted to chat with the king, WebSocket ensured their conversations were smooth and uninterrupted.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, WebRTC, the agile knight, was known for his real-time communications. Unlike WebSocket, WebRTC didn’t need a tunnel. Instead, he created direct pathways between villagers, enabling them to see and hear each other in real-time, like magic portals. These portals were perfect for video calls, voice chats, and peer-to-peer file sharing.</p>
            <p>One day, the villagers needed to organize a grand festival. WebSocket was summoned to keep everyone informed with real-time updates about the event. Simultaneously, WebRTC connected friends and family face-to-face, allowing them to plan and celebrate together, even from far.</p>
            <p>But with WebSocket’s reliable messaging and WebRTC’s real-time interactions, the festival was a resounding success, and the Forest of Connectivity thrived in harmony and joy.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical Analysis</h2>
            <p>In this fairytale, WebSocket creates a continuous, two-way communication channel between clients and servers, ideal for real-time updates and messaging.</p>
            <p>WebRTC, on the other hand, enables direct peer-to-peer communication for real-time audio, video, and data sharing.</p>
